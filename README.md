# Myoelectricity-based-prosthetic-hand
This repository contains the design and development files for a myoelectric prosthetic hand, created as part of the Smart India Hackathon 2025. As the leader of a six-member team, I was responsible for the complete mechanical design, building the prosthetic hand from scratch in SolidWorks, starting with a single finger joint and progressing to the fully assembled model. The CAD models were then 3D printed, and I worked with the team to assemble the hand and integrate the required electronics to create a fully automated prosthetic hand. While the project did not progress to the final round due to safety concerns raised by the judges, it provided valuable experience in end-to-end product development, mechanical design, and teamwork. This repository includes the SolidWorks part files (.SLDPRT), assembly files (.SLDASM), and printable files (.STL), along with images of the design and prototype for easy visualization.
