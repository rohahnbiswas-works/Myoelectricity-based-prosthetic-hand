# Myoelectricity-based-prosthetic-hand
Designed and led development of a myoelectric prosthetic hand for Smart India Hackathon 2025. Built complete SolidWorks models from finger joints to full assembly, 3D printed parts by myself and then integrated electronics along with the team. Repo includes .SLDPRT, .SLDASM, .STL files and images of the design.
